  <section class="page js-page"><p>The internet is a vast and dynamic space that connects billions of people and devices around the world. There are millions of websites that offer various kinds of information, services, entertainment, and communication. However, some websites are more popular and influential than others, attracting a large number of visitors and generating a lot of traffic. This article will show you some of the most-visited websites in the world, based on data from Semrush and Similarweb, two leading web analytics platforms.</p>

<h2>How are the most-visited websites ranked?</h2>
<p>There are different ways to measure and rank the popularity and traffic of websites, such as the number of unique visitors, page views, sessions, time spent, bounce rate, etc. However, one of the most common and widely used metrics is the monthly visits, which is the total number of visits to a website in a given month, regardless of how many times a visitor returns or how many pages they view. This metric reflects the overall reach and exposure of a website to the online audience.</p>

<p>However, measuring and comparing the monthly visits of websites is not a simple task, as different sources may use different methods and tools to collect and analyze the data. Therefore, the rankings and numbers may vary depending on the source and the time period. In this article, we will use the data from Semrush and Similarweb, two reputable and reliable web analytics platforms that offer comprehensive and up-to-date insights into the web traffic and performance of websites. Both platforms use a combination of direct measurement, panel data, web crawlers, and third-party sources to estimate the monthly visits of websites.</p>
